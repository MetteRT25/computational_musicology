# Homework week 9 ~ Computational Musicology
### **Mette Terpstra**

## Description of my project
I will analyze seasonal playlists I made over the years.My seasonal playlists are
summer and autumn with respectively 139 and 74 songs. I hypothesize that music I 
listen to in summer is happier, more danceable and has a faster tempo. Music in 
my autumn playlist will be slower and sadder. Furthermore, I will analyze what songs
Spotify recommends adding to these playlists. 

## Chromagram
Below is a chromagram for a song in my autumn playlist. It has mostly a C#, F and
Ab. Other than these pitches, F# and Bb are also frequent. I therefore conclude 
the song has the chords F# and C#, which are considered major chords. This is similar
to what I hear in the music.

A song from my summer playlist is Relax, Take It Easy from MIKA. What immediately
catches the eye, is the grey gap in the chromagram. This is a silent moment in 
the music. After it, you can hear someone talk. The talking has keys from all the
pitches, while the music is very structured with frequent pitches such as F#, E 
and C#.
